# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** Gift givers can reliably reserve and purchase gifts without duplicates — the reservation-to-purchase flow must be seamless and trustworthy.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — firebase-foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Firebase over SQLite — real-time sync required for shared registries
- Init: Cloud Tasks (not cron) for reservation expiry — per-reservation precision required
- Init: Affiliate URL transformation in Cloud Functions only — never in APK; allows merchant rule updates without Play Store release
- Init: EMAG catalog phase deliberately last — no confirmed public catalog API; manual URL add is the primary path
- [Phase 01-firebase-foundation]: firebase-functions/v2 import pattern (2nd gen Cloud Functions) — 1st gen deprecated
- [Phase 01-firebase-foundation]: Emulator Suite singleProjectMode=true on ports Auth=9099, Functions=5001, Firestore=8080, Hosting=5000, UI=4000
- [Phase 01-firebase-foundation]: Feature-namespaced key convention established: app_, common_, auth_, registry_, reservation_ prefixes prevent key collision across features
- [Phase 01-firebase-foundation]: assetlinks.json uses PLACEHOLDER values — will be updated in Phase 2 (package name) and Phase 5 (SHA-256 fingerprint)
- [Phase 01-firebase-foundation]: invitedUsers map (not array) for O(1) membership check in Firestore security rules
- [Phase 01-firebase-foundation]: reservations collection hard-deny (allow read, write: if false) — Admin SDK bypasses rules for Cloud Functions
- [Phase 01-firebase-foundation]: users delete disabled — account deletion requires backend business logic, not raw client delete

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 7 (EMAG Catalog): EMAG has no confirmed public product catalog API. A research spike is required before Phase 7 implementation planning begins. Integration strategy (2Performant affiliate links, WebView embed, URL paste as primary) is unresolved.
- Phase 4 (Reservation): Cloud Tasks cancellation API (`cloudTaskName` pattern) should be verified against current Firebase documentation before Phase 4 planning.
